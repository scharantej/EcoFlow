## Flask Application Design for Investor Newsfeed with Economic Calendar Data

### HTML Files

**index.html** (main page)
- Contains the frontend interface for user interaction and displaying the newsfeed.
- Includes a form for customizing event selection and a section to render the selected events.

**event_detail.html** (optional)
- Provides more information about a specific event when clicked on the newsfeed.

### Routes

**main.py** (Flask application core)
- `@app.route('/')` (main page): Renders the `index.html` page.
- `@app.route('/events')` (API endpoint): Fetches economic calendar data based on user customization and returns it in JSON format.
- `@app.route('/event_detail/<event_id>')` (optional): Displays more information about an event with the specified ID (`event_id`) in the `event_detail.html` page.

### Additional Notes

- The economic calendar data can be fetched from third-party APIs or databases.
- The user customization feature can be implemented using a form that allows users to select specific events or categories they are interested in.
- The newsfeed should be designed to be responsive and accessible on different devices.
- Consider implementing pagination for the newsfeed if the number of events is extensive.
- Add styling and design elements to enhance the user experience and make the newsfeed visually appealing.
